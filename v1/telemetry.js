/**
 * `telemetry.js` is the API for interfacing data aggregated for telemetry
 * dashboard. As of writing it mainly offers access to:
 *
 *  * Evolution of histograms over builds and time, and
 *  * Evolution of simple measures over build and time (as histograms)
 *
 * The goal for `telemetry.js` is to offer a stable, well documented, easy to
 * use, interface for aggregated telemetry data. So that anybody can access the
 * raw aggregates with the aim of developing and deploying custom dashboards.
 *
 *
 * ### Quick Start `telemetry.js`
 * _For a really quick start there is a demo on
 * [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/eGvw5/)._
 *
 *  1. Include `http://telemetry.mozilla.org/v1/telemetry.js`, you **must**
 *     include from here, **don't host it yourself**.
 *  2. Optionally, include `http://telemetry.mozilla.org/v1/big.js`,
 *     [big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/) is only needed for some
 *     features.
 *  3. Initialize `telemetry.js` with `Telemetry.init(callback)`
 *  4. Choose `'<channel>/<version>'` string from `Telemetry.versions()`
 *  5. Load measures for version with `Telemetry.measures(version, callback)`
 *  6. Load evolution of histogram for choice of version and measure with
 *     `Telemetry.loadEvolutionOverBuilds(version, measure, callback)`
 *  7. Iterate over histograms and dates, filter histograms, display results.
 *
 * **Step 3 through 7** are illustrated below
 *
 *     // First initialize telemetry.js (this loads some meta-data from server)
 *     Telemetry.init(function() {
 *       // Telemetry is now loaded an ready for use, we now get a list of
 *       // '<channel>/<version>' strings
 *       var versions = Telemetry.versions();
 *
 *       // We then pick a version, in this the first
 *       var version = versions[0];
 *
 *       // Then we load measures available for the given version
 *       Telemetry.measures(version, function(measures) {
 *         // In this callback `measures` is now a JSON object on the form:
 *         // {MEASURE_ID: {kind: "linear", description: "..."}, ...}
 *         // Let's choose a measure id, say 'CYCLE_COLLECTOR' if available
 *         var measure = 'CYCLE_COLLECTOR';
 *         if (measures['CYCLE_COLLECTOR'] === undefined) {
 *           // If 'CYCLE_COLLECTOR' isn't available we just pick any other
 *           // measure, say the first in the list of keys on the JSON object
 *           measure = Object.keys(measures)[0];
 *         }
 *
 *         // We then load evolution of this measure over build dates
 *         Telemetry.loadEvolutionOverBuilds(version, measure,
 *                                           function(histogramEvolution) {
 *           // The HistogramEvolution instance holds a set of dates and
 *           // histograms, we can iterate over them as follows
 *           histogramEvolution.each(function(date, histogram) {
 *             // First let's log the date of the histogram, in this case we
 *             // have a build date and number of submissions
 *             console.log("For builds on " + date.toString() + " we have");
 *             console.log(histogram.submissions() + "submissions and");
 *
 *             // We can also iterate over buckets in the histogram, map is
 *             // just a convenient adaption of Javascripts `Array.map`
 *             console.log(histogram.map(function(count, start, end, index) {
 *               return count + " hits between " + start + " and " + end;
 *             }).join('\n'));
 *           });
 *         });
 *       });
 *     });
 *
 * ### Deployment and API Stability
 * It is the **intend** that the APIs documented here should remain stable.
 * And going forward consumers of telemetry dashboard data should be comfortable
 * including `telemetry.js` from:
 *
 *   * `http://telemetry.mozilla.org/v1/telemetry.js`
 *
 * As `telemetry.js` separates data access from data storage layout, this will
 * enable telemetry-dashboard developers to change data storage layout as well
 * as adding features to `telemetry.js` without breaking custom dashboards
 * deployed in the wild.
 *
 * Again, there is no guarantee that all functions in `telemetry.js` will
 * continue to work exactly like they do now, this isn't a Mars rover project,
 * this is a promised of best efforts. If it should ever become desired to
 * refactor `telemetry.js` there will probably be implemented a shim that
 * exposes the old API and host at `telemetry.mozilla.org/v1/telemetry.js`.
 *
 * **Warning** `telemetry.js` does include URLs point to data on the server,
 * these URLs will be subject to change **without warning**. So you should
 * never included `telemetry.js` form any where other than the official URL
 * noted below.
 *
 *   * `http://telemetry.mozilla.org/v1/telemetry.js`
 *
 * If you distribute your own version of `telemetry.js` or access the raw data
 * around `telemetry.js` you should expect your code to break at anytime.
 * The only supported way to consume telemetry dashboard data is through
 * `telemetry.js` included from the source directed above.
 *
 * ### Auxiliary Libraries
 * The drop-down selectors used on the [dashboard](telemetry.mozilla.org) are
 * fairly non-trivial to implement. Luckily, they are provided as an individual
 * component in `jquery.telemetry.js`, this requires the jQuery UI widget
 * factory, which can be found in `jquery.ui.widget.js`. You may also optionally
 * use `bootstrap-selector.js` with
 * [bootstrap-select](http://silviomoreto.github.io/bootstrap-select/) to get
 * pretty [twitter-bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) selectors.
 *
 * Take a look at the sources for telemetry-dashboard to see how
 * `jquery.telemetry.js` works, it's also fairly well documented in source. To
 * use these files hot-linking is, however, not recommended. Distribute them on
 * your own and update them as the dashboard gets updated. It's only
 * `telemetry.js` that should be included from `telemetry.mozilla.org`.

 *
 * ### Performance Considerations
 * Behind the scenes `Telemetry.Histogram` instances holds a list of histograms
 * for different dates and filters, as you drill-down the number of dates and
 * filters, histograms are excluded from consideration. This makes filtering
 * and instantiation of `Histogram` instances very fast, as a `Histogram` is
 * essentially just a virtual view of existing data.
 *
 * However, whenever you access data on a `Telemetry.Histogram` instance the
 * view will be lazily materialized behind the scenes. This is great for
 * performance, unless, `Histogram` instance is immediately discarded.
 *
 * So while it may be tempting to use `HistogramEvolution.map` once for each
 * series you want to plot. It is often much better to use
 * `HistogramEvolution.each` and reused the materialized view. See the good/bad
 * examples below for illustration.
 *
 * **Bad example**, the example below offers poor performance because the
 * `Histogram` instances are created twice and as we access data on these
 * instances, hence, the underlying view is materialized twice.
 *
 *     // Get a list of means and a list of medians (bad performing example)
 *     var means = histogramEvolution.map(function(date, histogram, index) {
 *       return histogram.mean();
 *     });
 *     var medians = histogramEvolution.map(function(date, histogram, index) {
 *       return histogram.median();
 *     });
 *     // Now, we can plot means and medians
 *
 * **Good example**, the example below offers better performance because only
 * one `Histogram` instance is created per data point, hence, the materialized
 * view lazily created for computation of `mean` can be reused for estimation
 * `median`.
 *
 *     // Create a list of means and a list of medians (good performing example)
 *     var means   = [],
 *         medians = [];
 *     histogramEvolution.each(function(date, histogram, index) {
 *       means[index]    = histogram.mean();
 *       medians[index]  = histogram.medians();
 *     });
 *     // Now, we can plot means and medians
 *
 * The above example is just to illustrate a common performance trap with `map`,
 * there are many legitimate uses for `map`.
 *
 * @param {Function}  cb                Mapping to be invoked with histograms
 * @param {Object}    ctx               Optional, context for the callback

/**
 * Representation of a histogram is a set of buckets with intervals a count for

 *
 * Consider a measure measure the amount of time a given operation takes, for
 * such a measure the first bucket may start at zero and end at 1 ms, then
 * _count_ of the first bucket is the number of times the operation finished
 * between 0 and 1ms. See [histogram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram)
 * for deeper explanation of histograms.
 *
 * A `Telemetry.Histogram` instance can be obtained from an instance of
 * `Telemetry.HistogramEvolution`, see `loadEvolutionOverBuilds` or
 * `loadEvolutionOverTime` for how to obtain one of those.
 *
 * When you have a `Histogram` instance, you can `filter` it by available
 * `filterOptions`. You can iterate over buckets and counts with
 * `each`, compute statistics such as `mean`, standardDeviation` or estimate
 * more complicated statistics like `median` and `percentile`'s.
 *
 * The following example demonstrates how to obtain a `Histogram` instance and
 * print the number of telemetry submissions aggregated in the histogram.
 *
 *     Telemetry.loadEvolutionOverBuilds('nightly/25', 'CYCLE_COLLECTOR',
 *                                       function(histogramEvolution) {

 *       var histogram = histogramEvolution.range();
 *
 *       // Now log the number of submissions aggregated in the histogram
 *       console.log(histogram.submissions());
 *     });
 *
 *
 * The above example is just an illustration, you should not hard-code
 * the `'<channel>/<version>'` or measure identifier strings. Valid values for
 * these parameters can be obtained from `Telemetry.versions` and
 * `Telemetry.measures`.
 *
 * **Remark** you should never instantiate `Telemetry.Histogram` instances on
 * your own. The constructor is exposed to facilitate use with `instanceof`,
 * parameters taken by the constructor is not part of the public stable
